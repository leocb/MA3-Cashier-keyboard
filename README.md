# MA3 Cashier Keyboard

This is a poor man's version of the programming wing for the MA3 onPC lighting software. This is a simple keyboard HID that sends the keyboard shortcuts to the PC, in the future I want to implement an OSC server to send macros or more complex commands to the MA software.

It's made of an old second hand cashier keyboard and an Arduino Pro Micro (ATMega32U4) with the pins soldered at the keyboard matrix.

A quick Arduino program scans the keyboard as fast as possible and sends the appropriate shortcut to the computer as a simple keyboard HID.

Included in this repo is the Arduino code and the keyboard stickers - MA Please don't sue me, thanks :)
